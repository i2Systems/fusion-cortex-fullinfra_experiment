# Theme System

Fusion/Cortex supports 9 different themes, each with unique visual characteristics. All themes use the same design tokens, ensuring components adapt automatically.

## Available Themes

### 1. Dark (Default)
The default dark theme with neon cyan accents and glass morphism effects.

### 2. Light
A light theme with high contrast and clean aesthetics.

### 3. High Contrast
Maximum contrast theme for accessibility, with stark black/white contrast.

### 4. Warm Night
A warmer dark theme with cozy, ambient lighting.

### 5. Warm Day
A warm, sunny light theme with soft colors.

### 6. Glass Neumorphism
Soft, tactile design with subtle depth and shadows.

### 7. Business Fluent
Professional theme inspired by Microsoft Fluent Design.

### 8. On Brand
Brand-focused theme with consistent color application.

### 9. On Brand Glass
Glass morphism variant of the on-brand theme.

## Theme Switching

Use the **Theme** selector in the Storybook toolbar (top right) to switch between themes and see how components adapt.

## How It Works

Themes are applied via the `data-theme` attribute on the document root. All components use CSS custom properties (design tokens) that automatically update when the theme changes.

```css
/* Example: Primary color changes per theme */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-primary: #00d9ff; /* Neon cyan */
}

[data-theme="light"] {
  --color-primary: #0066cc; /* Deep blue */
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always use design tokens (`var(--color-primary)`) instead of hard-coded colors
- Test components in multiple themes to ensure proper contrast
- Use semantic color names (primary, danger, success) rather than specific colors
- Ensure text remains readable in all themes
